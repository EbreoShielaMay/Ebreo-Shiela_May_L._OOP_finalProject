# D'Bookstore :cherry_blossom: :book: :sparkles:

D'Bookstore is a digital bookstore management system designed to streamline book purchases and enhance the shopping experience. The system allows users to:

* :bookmark_tabs: Browse book categories, including physical books and eBooks.

* :shopping_cart: Add books to a cart or purchase directly.

* :moneybag: Manage their wallet balance for seamless transactions.

* :receipt: View detailed purchase receipts for clarity and record-keeping.

This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for book enthusiasts while integrating sustainable practices aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## OOP Principles application :computer:
This project employs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability:

### Encapsulation :pill:
* Each class (e.g., User, BookCategory, Display) encapsulates its data and methods, ensuring that related functionalities are grouped logically.

* Access to class attributes is restricted via private modifiers, with getters and setters providing controlled access.
  
### Imheritance :family:
* The Book class is extended into two specialized classes: PhysicalBook and eBook, enabling reuse of common attributes while adding specific features.
  
### Abstraction :atm:
* The Display class abstracts the user interface, keeping UI-related logic separate from the core business logic.

* The BookCategory class abstracts the management of books, hiding the complexity of book organization.
  
### Polymorphism :butterfly:
* The Purchasable interface defines a purchase method implemented differently by various classes, allowing a unified handling of purchasable items.
